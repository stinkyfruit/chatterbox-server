Chatterbox server
==============

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor. This project was worked on with a pair. Chattterbox Server is an API server buit with node.js that replace the parse API. The server application contain some utils and routing and work with the [Chatterbox client](https://github.com/nickbalestra/Chatterbox-client) supporting all his features.

## Structure:

The repository consist of

- Server app
- [Client app](https://github.com/nickbalestra/Chatterbox-client)
- test Specs files.

#### Chatterbox server 

The server features at a glance :

- GET/POST/OPTIONS requests. 
- Support CORS to handle cross domain issues. 
- Serve Static Assets (css/html/js/img)
- Persistent storage on file.

Its architecture allows to easily extend the request handler router and add as many endpoints as needed.

## Install:

The project rely on bower and npm for managing external libraries and dependencies, so be sure to first:

`bower install`

`npm install`

to run it, simply run `node basic-server.js` and open the client/index.html file with your browser.
In particular:

- `./server/basic-server.js`
- `./client/index.html`

Make sure to have a valid config.js inside the env folder.
